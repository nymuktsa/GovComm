	<h1 class="h"> Our Founding!</h1>
    <p> We started when the Scotts realized that their neighborhood and home was slowly being taken out by their new neighbors.<br>
     Their new neighbors were at first friendly, but then they invited their friends to clean up the neighborhood.</p> <p> Little did they know that this would mean their culture and history would also be cleaned  and white washed.</p>
	
	<p> As more folks moved into the area, they got the sense that most of their current neighbors would move out, or worse, be evicted. They rushed against time to fight the erasure of their identities and origins, and thus came the Yam. </p>

	<h2 class="h"> Our First Project </h2>
	
<p>As an off-shoot of the then Bronx Social Center, The Yam's first project was, in true Bronx fashion, a protest and boycott. As the movement died out, The Yam originally existed as an archive for the grassroots' activities. Eventually, it exploded in popularity, causing the Smiths and other various founders, like the newly elected NYC mayor, Zohran Mamdani, to expand out of the Bronx and NYC into other cities and regions. <br>
	No ever forgot the mission; in fact, expansion allowed them to further their reach into cities like London, Atlanta, LA, and Chicago, and grow their reach into other disciplines, such as Climate Change, Rural Expansion, and dealt experience of Intersetionality when it comes to gentrification.</p>

	<h1 class="h"> Small Business Anti-Displacement Network</h1>
	<p> In partnership with the University of Maryland's faculty and students in the National Center for Small Growth Research and Education, we conducted research about the impact of small business in different terrains and the effect gentrification had on them. We also created a network of grassroots organizations that help low-income BIPOC and minority business owners stay open for them and their community. Some issues that affect them are rising rent, maintenance, and supply costs. Such organizations include but aren't limited to the <a href="https://www.nationalcapacd.org/"> National CAPACD </a> and <a href="https://inclusiveaction.org/">Inclusive Action for the City.</a></p>

	<p> ... realized that their neighborhood and home was slowly being taken out by their new neighbors.<br>
     Their new neighbors were at first friendly, but then they invited their friends to clean up the neighborhood.</p> <p> Little did they know that this would mean their culture and history would also be cleaned.</p>
	
	<p> As more folks moved into the area, they got the sense that most of their current neighbors would move out, or worse, be evicted. They rushed against time to fight the erasure of their identities and origins, and thus came The Yam. </p>
	
	<h2 class="h"> What's your deal?</h2>

	<p> We want to get rid of history erasure, inequality and inequity of all kinds. However, to knack at it on a systemic level, we have to start small. Begin close to home, in your neighborhoods.</p>
	
<h3 class="h"> Why?</h3>
	<p> We're sure most can relate,but everyone has been fed a narrative of history to control history, to control the status quo, We want to change that  so we can progress forward whilst holding on to traditions. Lost traditions and traditions past to learn more about the people, the land, and how it relates to and influences the world beyond.</p>
	<h4 class="h"> To be clear, what is gentrification?</h4>
	<p> Gentrification is the process by with the higher class seek to change the feel and identity of a area, region, or neighborhood by moving in and improving the quality and value of the area. Some wary effects of this are the displacement of the original residents and the ignorance of current issues facing the area, or its relation to its proximity. </p>
	<h5 class="h"> Why the Yam?</h5>
	<p> Many people mistake yams for sweet potatoes. Although they are slightly related, they are very different. Subtly, they've moved on from their original meanings, such as identity, status, sensuality, or  even, substance abuse. Like yams, gentrification can change how people see a community and the feel of it because of its association with classism and elitism. Things considered as primitive, savage, or dirty are now sanitized and repackaged into something it was never meant to be. And like yams, gentrification affects the voiceless and the climate. Yams are a complex symbol in non-white and working class communities. When gentrified, yams, like these communities, lose their complexity and depth, in exchange for shallow variants to the wealthy few. </p>

	<h1 class="h"> Small Business Anti-Displacement Network</h1>
	<p> In partnership with the University of Maryland's faculty and students in the National Center for Small Growth Research and Education, we conducted research about the impact of small business in different terrains and the effect gentrification had on them. We also created a network of grassroots organizations that help low-income BIPOC and minority business owners stay open for them and their community. Some issues that affect them are rising rent, maintenance, and supply costs. Such organizations include but aren't limited to the <a href="https://www.nationalcapacd.org/"> National CAPACD </a> and <a href="https://inclusiveaction.org/">Inclusive Action for the City.</a></p>

<h2 class="h">Denver, CO </h2>
	<p>In the height of 2024, Denver, CO was the 2nd most heavily gentrified city in the US, just behind San Francisco, CA. To combat this, The City and County of Denver, CO worked alongside a multitude of grassroots and anti-gentrification organizations including us. With them, we created a framework that would help majority-minority communities to thrive by preventing zoning changes and offering resources such as those presented on this page.

	<p> You've come to the right place!</p>
	<h2 class="h"> Food </h2>
	<p> We have worked with many non-profits, local food pantries and kitchens, and community restaurants that have aided in helping folks get their food as well as teach skills in the culinary arts and home cooking. Many of our collaborators include but aren't limited to national and global networks such as </p>
	<ul> 
		<li> <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/home?r=n&o=b">Feeding America</a></li>
		<li> <a href="https://wck.org/">WCK - World Central Kitchen</a></li>
		<li> <a href="https://www.heritage-foundation.org/">Heritage Foundation USA</a></li>
		<li> <a href="https://shareourstrength.org/"> Share Our Strength</a></li> 
		<li> <a href="https://www.care.org/">Care.Org</a></li>
</ul>
	<p> There are also regional organizations that also work with us such as...
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.feedingthegulfcoast.org/">Feeding the Gulf Coast (South)</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://volunteer.hoiunitedway.org/agency/detail/?agency_id=87516"> Midwest Food Bank (Midwest)</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://home.wsfb.org/"> Westside Food Bank (Pacific Far West)</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://threesquaresne.org/">3 Squares New England (Northeast)</a></li>	
    </ul>
	</p>
<h3 class="h">Housing </h3> 
	<p> 
	Although there aren't as many international housing organizations aimed at ending gentrification-related homelessness or displacement, this doesn't mean that work can't be done on a National or Regional level such as in these states. There are various organizations and coalitions that work, whether daily or on occassion that strive to end displacement, specifically of those from gentrified communities.
	National organizations aimed at ending the displacement of millions of people from their communities but are not limited to... 
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="https://www.restcentres.org/"> The Rest Centres for Canada BIPOC </a></li>
		<li> <a href="https://atticyouthcenter.org/"> The Attic Youth Center For Oppressed Gender and GRSM Youth</a></li>
		<li> <a href="https://www.marysplaceseattle.org/"> Mary's Place (Pacific Far West)</a> </li>
		<li> <a href="https://stfrancishouse.org/"> St. Francis House (Northeast)</a></li>	
</ul>

	<h4 class="h">Clothing </h4>
	<p> Gentrification affects both the big and little things many communities' lives. One such thing is clothing. When a community is gentrified, the clothing used by the original community can go through horrid processes. It could be discarded and thrown out, furthering the climate crisis. The clothing, via gentrification, could also lose its cultural significance, and in the hands of the wrong, it could lead to cultural appropriation and polished-up stereotypes of certain demographics, leading to the trap of "My Culture is not Your Costume". We have teamed up with several coalitions that desire to fix this.
<br> Such as are the following below:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://simplerecycling.com/"> Simple Recycling</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/indigenous-fashion-designers-cultural-appropriation-activism"> Support Native Fashion Designers</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://clarkstonconsulting.com/insights/appropriation-vs-appreciation-for-brands/"> Tips on Combatting cultural appropriation in Fashion.</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://zerowastedaniel.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor5tqolCSkjejqnFy7fdc2RXtViQBwrhQjM-3Y2ZjyoAyG1LAMN">Upcycled Clothes</a></li>	
</ul>
</p>
	<h5 class="h">Transit</h5>
	<p>We understand most gentrified communities don't have great means of commute. Typically, communting to and fro people's work, schooling and third places can be tricky, especially they're minors or can't drive or own a car. This leads to them being inaccessible, and when gentrified, public transport is usually worsened by the lack of people needing to use it. We'vs formed coalitions around the country to make sure people can get to their livelihoods without struggle, such as below.
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.ridersalliance.org/"> Riders Alliance</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://www.publictransportation.org/napta/"> NAPTA(National Alliance of Public Transport Advocates)</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://www.transbaycoalition.org/">Transbay Coalition (Pacific Far West)</a></li>
</ul>
	</p>
	<h6 class="h">Wellbeing and Rehab </h6> 
	<p>Prior to gentrification, most communities, regardless of region, don't have easy access to healthcare and medical care. Whether it's because of lack of funds, too far of a distance, or simple distrust, we have worked together with people like the Medical Mythbuster himself, <a href="https://joelbervell.com/"> Joel Bervell.</a> More than that, we recognize that disabled, AFAB, BIPOC and queer people all have a higher chance of medical malpractice to Medical Discrimation and myths. Alongside that, zoning issues affect anyone's chance of getting urgent treatment because of who doctors, medicene, and hospitals are most readily available.
<br> Don't worry; there's still a number of grassroots of groups that seek to relieve these issues. Just look below!
